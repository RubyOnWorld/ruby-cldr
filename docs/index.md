## ruby-cldr

`ruby-cldr` is a Ruby library for exporting data from Unicode Consortium's Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR).

CLDR contains tons of high-quality locale data such as formatting rules for dates, times, numbers, currencies as well as language, country, calendar-specific names etc.

For localizing applications in Ruby we obviously want to use this incredibly comprehensive and well-maintained resource.

See the [README](https://github.com/ruby-i18n/ruby-cldr) for more information.
